A core principle in many ML systems is to select actions that minimize the expected loss (or risk, though that term can be ambiguous). This approach, rooted in a theory of rational agency, aims to optimize performance, such as maximizing long-term gains in a gambling setting. While model-making is central to ML, the focus is often on achieving accurate predictions and effective decision-making, rather than solely on discovering underlying causal processes. ML systems can employ various types of models, including non-parametric models that generate predictions directly from the data in response to queries. The strength of ML lies in its ability to provide fast, robust, and efficient solutions for a wide range of applications, including face detection, speech recognition, and various language-processing tasks. Essentially, ML is the go-to approach for many applications that involve understanding data or signals from the real world and using that understanding to make informed choices or forecasts, often by minimizing expected loss.'"
